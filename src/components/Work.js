            As a debug tester, I work with other testers to identify errors
            within Nintendo video games prior to their release to the public.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            I provide detailed write-ups and visual reproductions of the bugs to
            be corrected. Examples of these flaws in the games can be anything
            from crashes and distortions to less-severe inconsistencies in text
            or graphics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to manually testing the games, I also collaborate with
            the automation team by proposing gameplay areas to test with
            scripts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a whole, this role has taught me the importance of testing in the
            software development life cycle and the skills to more exhaustively
            test and debug my own code.

            During my three years at UWâ€“La Crosse, I was part of the front-line
            of tech support for students and faculty at the university.
          </p>
          <p>
            While troubleshooting clients' software issues, I helped train and
            lead the team of 12 student technicians. I developed strong skills
            communicating to users of a wide range of technical backgrounds, and
            I became exceptionally comfortable working as a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also worked to prevent future issues by helping user-test
            university web applications and creating client-facing documentation
            for new applications and user processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I wasn't writing any code at this position, I gained
            valuable first-hand experience seeing users interact with software,
            and it helped me become a more end product-focused developer.
