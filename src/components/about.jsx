            Hi, I'm Andrew Smith.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, WA who loves building
            convenient and streamlined applications that make life just a little
            bit easier. I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science which I
            obtained with honours at the University of Wisconsinâ€“La Crosse after
            just three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the technologies I've been working with recently include
            Java, Spring, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, HTML, and CSS. I
            enjoy working on both the back-end and front-end, and I'm currently
            looking for an entry-level position!
          </p>
          <p>
            My time outside of work is usually spent going on hikes with my
            girlfriend and dog, hunting PS4 trophies, and learning alternative
            rock on my guitar.
