              Trackd is a Spring Boot app for users to easily make lists of
              their favorite songs in any given genre or topic. Lists are stored
              with their dates of creation, so it's easy to use the app as your
              very own personal mixtape diary.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used JPA and Hibernate to easily map my SQL database of tracks
              and tracklists to their respective Java objects. With Lombok, I
              was able to cut down on the boilerplate code in my Java classes
              and focus on the meat of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              I relied on Thymeleaf to dynamically fill my HTML documents with
              any newly-added track or tracklists, and I adapted a Bootstrap
              template to quickly ensure the front-end looked good and was
              responsive.

              Band Trees allows users to discover new bands by finding related
              artists in a more refined way than what other music apps provide.
              Users can trace history through the influences of some of the
              world's most important rock bands and the others they went on to
              inspire.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked with a partner to gather information on the specific
              influences of some of my favorite bands and relate them to each
              other with a SQLite database. I also created tables to include
              brief biographical information and a small selection of songs to
              give the user a more comprehensive view of the artist.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used React to compartmentalize the data into more manageable
              chunks and ensure the single-page front-end was updated and served
              efficiently. The RESTful API was created with the help of
              Express.js, and I used Node.js for the real-time communication
              between all the app's components.

            <p>
              Hangman is a web app version of the classic word-guessing game
              that provides users with a sizeable selection of customization
              features, including difficulty, theme colors, and fonts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The single-page web app was developed primarily with JavaScript,
              and I relied on jQuery and AJAX to dynamically update the page and
              asynchronously retrieve and send its data. I also supplemented my
              HTML and CSS code with Bootstrap in order to efficiently keep the
              interface user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The back-end includes a RESTful Node/Express API that I created to
              store and serve each of the userâ€™s games along with their custom
              difficulties, colors, and fonts.
