          Hi, I'm Andrew Smith.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I'm a software developer based in Seattle, WA who loves building
          convenient and streamlined applications that make life a little easier
          or more exciting. I have a Bachelor of Science in computer science
          which I obtained with honours at the University of Wisconsinâ€“La Crosse
          after just three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the technologies I've been working with recently include Java,
          JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. I
          enjoy working on both the back-end and front-end, and I'm currently
          looking for an entry-level position!
        </p>
        <p>
          My time outside of work is usually spent going on hikes with my
          girlfriend and dog, hunting PS4 trophies, and learning alternative
          rock on my guitar.
